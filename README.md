## Hardware Components
- **Microcontroller**: STC8H1K08 or similar.
- **LEDs**: 4 LEDs for voltage indication.
- **Buzzer**: For audio indication at high voltage.
- **Resistors**: For LED current limiting and voltage divider.
- **Capacitors**: For decoupling.
- **DC-DC Converter**: To regulate voltage for the microcontroller.
- **PCB**: Custom-designed 2-layer PCB.

## How It Works
1. The ADC reads the voltage between two points.
2. The firmware maps the ADC value to 10 levels.
3. LEDs illuminate corresponding to the voltage level:
   - 1 LED for the lowest level.
   - Up to 4 LEDs for the highest levels.
4. The buzzer beeps when the highest level is reached.

## Circuit Design
The circuit includes:
- ADC input with a voltage divider (if required).
- GPIO pins for LED and buzzer control.
- Power supply with a DC-DC converter.

Refer to the `schematic.pdf` file for the complete circuit diagram.

## Firmware Implementation
The firmware:
- Initializes the ADC for continuous sampling.
- Maps ADC results to voltage levels.
- Controls GPIO pins to activate LEDs and buzzer.

Refer to the [`main.c`](main.c) file for the complete firmware code.
